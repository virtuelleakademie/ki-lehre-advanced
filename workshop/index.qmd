In this workshop, we will cover the following topics:

- Using the OpenAI API
- Controlling the output of LLMs with parameter settings
- Generating structured output with the OpenAI API

We will work with the GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o models from OpenAI. Note that we could also use local models, but this would require a bit more setup and is outside the scope of this workshop.

The focus of this workshop is on using the OpenAI API, so we will only discuss Python in passing. We will be working with [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) and optionally [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). If working with Visual Studio Code, we recommend that you install an AI coding assistant, such as [Github Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/). For beginners, this will help to get you started with Python. 


The workshop is structured as follows:

(@) Introduction
(@) Setup coding environment
    + setup Python 
    + setup VSCode 
    + install Github Copilot
(@) Verify OpenAI installation
(@) Using the OpenAI API
(@) Project: Use GPT-4o to generate Anki flashcards
(@) Conclusions and discussion
