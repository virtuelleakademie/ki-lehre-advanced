    "As the examples above show, the `temperature` and `top_p` parameters can have a significant effect on the response. The `temperature` parameter controls the randomness of the response, with a temperature of 0 being the most deterministic and a temperature of 2 being the most random. The `top_p` parameter controls the diversity of the response.\n",
    "Increasing the temperature above approximately 1.7 may result in syntactically incorrect language---this can be mitigated by lowering the `top_p` parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Understanding the Interaction Between `top_p` and `temperature` in Text Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "When using language models, the `top_p` and `temperature` parameters play crucial roles in shaping the generated text. While both control the randomness and creativity of the output, they operate differently and can interact in complementary or conflicting ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. What is `temperature`?\n",
    "\n",
    "The `temperature` parameter adjusts the **probability distribution** over the possible next tokens:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lower values (e.g., 0.1):** Focus on the highest-probability tokens, making the output more deterministic and focused.\n",
    "- **Higher values (e.g., 1.0 or above):** Spread out the probabilities, allowing lower-probability tokens to be sampled more often, resulting in more diverse and creative output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, `temperature` modifies the token probabilities \\( p_i \\) as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p_i' = \\frac{p_i^{1/\\text{temperature}}}{\\sum p_i^{1/\\text{temperature}}}$$\n",

    "- At `temperature = 1.0`: No adjustment, the original probabilities are used.\n",

    "- At `temperature > 1.0`: Probabilities are flattened (more randomness).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. What is `top_p`?\n",
    "\n",
    "The `top_p` parameter, also known as nucleus sampling, restricts token selection to those with the highest cumulative probability \\( p \\):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Tokens are sorted by their probabilities.\n",
    "2. Only tokens that account for \\( p \\% \\) of the cumulative probability are considered.\n",
    "   - **Lower values (e.g., 0.1):** Only the most probable tokens are included.\n",
    "   - **Higher values (e.g., 0.9):** A broader set of tokens is included, allowing for more diverse outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike `temperature`, `top_p` dynamically adapts to the shape of the probability distribution.\n",

    "### 3. How Do `temperature` and `top_p` Interact?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a. **Low `temperature` + Low `top_p`**\n",
    "- Behavior: Highly deterministic.\n",
    "- Use Case: Tasks requiring precise and factual responses (e.g., technical documentation, Q&A).\n",
    "- Interaction: \n",
    "  - **Low `temperature`** sharply focuses the probability distribution, and **low `top_p`** further restricts token choices.\n",

    "#### b. **Low `temperature` + High `top_p`**\n",
    "- Behavior: Slightly creative but still constrained.\n",
    "- Use Case: Formal content generation with slight variability.\n",
    "- Interaction:\n",
    "  - **Low `temperature`** ensures focused probabilities, but **high `top_p`** allows more token options.\n",
    "  - Result: Outputs are coherent with minimal creativity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### c. **High `temperature` + Low `top_p`**\n",
    "- Behavior: Controlled randomness.\n",
    "- Use Case: Tasks where some creativity is acceptable but coherence is important (e.g., storytelling with a clear structure).\n",
    "- Interaction:\n",
    "  - **High `temperature`** flattens the probabilities, introducing more randomness, but **low `top_p`** limits the selection to the most probable tokens.\n",
    "  - Result: Outputs are creative but still coherent.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### d. **High `temperature` + High `top_p`**\n",
    "- Behavior: Highly creative and diverse.\n",
    "- Use Case: Tasks requiring out-of-the-box ideas (e.g., brainstorming, poetry).\n",
    "- Interaction:\n",
    "  - **High `temperature`** increases randomness, and **high `top_p`** allows even lower-probability tokens to be included.\n",
